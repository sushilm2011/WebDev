<h1>Java Servlets Assignment</h1>
<strong>Ass_31:</strong> Design a HTML page to create an account. The page should contain one text box for login name chosen, two password boxes (for double verification), one for email address, one for your name and one for your contact number and others ( if you think necessary) . When a visitor provide these data, validate them using JavaScript code. If all data are correct, send it to JSP program (say create.jsp) which inserts the data into database tables. Also write pages to check whether a user can now login or not.
